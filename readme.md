## DSA Questions
6. Simple Interest Calculation
   
**Statement:** Calculate the simple interest based on the principal amount (\(P\)), the rate of interest (\(r\)), and the time period (\(t\)) in years, with all three values provided by the user.

**Example:**
```
Input: P = 1000, r = 5, t = 3
Output: 150
```

5. Even-Odd Sum Challenge

**Statement:** Given a positive integer \( n \), compute the sum of the even numbers from 1 to \( n \) and the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to \( n \) separately. Return these two sums.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 12, 9
```
 > Explanation: The even numbers from 1 to 6 are 2, 4, and 6. Their sum is 2+4+6=12. The odd numbers from 1 to 6 are 1, 3, and 5. Their sum is 1+3+5=9. So, the output is 12, 9.

4. Largest of three Numbers
Statement: Given three numbers x, y, and z which aim is to get the largest among these three numbers.
**Example:**
```
Input: x = 7, y = 20, z = 56
Output: 56
```

3. Create a program that takes two numbers \( m \) and \( n \) from the user and prints all the numbers from 1 up to \( n \), incrementing by \( m \).

**Example:**
```
Input:
Enter the value of m: 3
Enter the value of n: 10

Output:
1 4 7 10
```
---
2. Develop a program that takes a number \( a \) from the user and prints all the numbers from \( a \) down to 1 in reverse order.

**Example:**
```
Input:
Enter a number: 5

Output:
5 4 3 2
```
---
1. Write a program that takes three inputs from the user, \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), and determines the smallest number among them.
   
**Example:**
```
Input:
Enter the value of a: 5
Enter the value of b: 3
Enter the value of c: 7

Output:
The smallest number is 3
```
