2. Develop a program that takes a number \( a \) from the user and prints all the numbers from \( a \) down to 1 in reverse order.

**Example:**
```
Input:
Enter a number: 5

Output:
5 4 3 2 1
```

3. Create a program that takes two numbers \( m \) and \( n \) from the user and prints all the numbers from 1 up to \( n \), incrementing by \( m \).

**Example:**
```
Input:
Enter the value of m: 3
Enter the value of n: 10

Output:
1 4 7 10
